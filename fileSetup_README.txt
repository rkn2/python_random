before that..anything goes... (mostly on google drive)

Structure of data: 
functions are kept on my computer in the github folder
scripts are kept in the google drive folder associated with the project
all of the generated data is kept on my computer temporarily in the datafiles section. after a project is over, they are uploaded to google drive in the "data" section but are not kept with the rest so that it does not all sync/download all the time. 
^might change with filestream
